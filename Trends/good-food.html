                <h4>Carbo hydrates</h4>
                The main task of Carbo Hydrates is, turn into Blood sugar and give energy to body. One more task is creating anti-bodies with help of proteins.
                Carbs helps to build Bones and Cartilage. Carbo hydrates also generate Synovial Fluid(which helps like grease in leg joints.)
                If we take more Carbs.. the exces carbs will deposit in liver and muscles. We will get 4 calories from 1 gram Carbs.
                <br /><strong>Note:</strong> Carbs helps to get consume Fats, without Carbs body can not consume Fats efficiently.
                If Carbs lack, will get ketosis
