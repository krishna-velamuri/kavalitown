                    Leggings are a type of fitted clothing covering the legs, which can be worn by both
                    men and women. Originally leggings were two separate garments, one for each leg.
                    Modern leggings are typically made from a blend of Lycra, spandex, nylon, cotton,
                    or polyester blend, but they can also be made from wool, silk and other materials.
                    Leggings are available in a multitude of colors and decorative designs.

                    Leggings are sometimes worn fully exposed, and are more traditionally worn partially
                    covered by a garment such as a skirt, a large t-shirt or shorts, or fully covered
                    by an outer garment, such as a full length skirt. Leggings are typically ankle-length,
                    and some are stirrupped or encase the feet. Some are shorter. Leggings are worn
                    to keep a person's legs warm, as protection from chafing during an activity such
                    as exercise or as a decorative or fashion garment. Leggings are worn by both men
                    and women when exercising, but usually only by women at other times.

            In contemporary usage, leggings refers to tight, form-fitting trousers that extend from the waist to the ankles. In the United States, they are
            sometimes referred to as tights. However, the two words are not synonymous as the word tights refers to opaque pantyhose.

            <h4>Based on Legs</h4>
            <p>
                The length of the leggings can accentuate their legs to various degrees. While knee-length leggings flatter legs more effectively thanks to a wider calf,
                mid-calf leggings will better suit a wearer with slim legs. Ankle-length leggings are a great choice for all body types and can give the legs an elongated
                appearance when they are worn with high-heeled shoes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Black and darker-colored leggings will have a slimming effect on the wearer's legs and will flatter all body shapes.
                On the other hand, lighter or brighter-colored leggings and leggings with bold patterns tend to draw attention to the wearer's legs.
                Heavier set women should try dark colors.
