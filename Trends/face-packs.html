                <h4>Cucumber </h4>
                Cucumber is the natural astringent. It also helps tightening skin and slows down
                the aging process. Hence, cucumber is a must have in your beauty regime. Grate cucumber
                and extract the juice. Apply the juice on your face with cotton ball. Let it dry
                on your face for 20 mins. Time-to-time, reapply the juice. Rinse your face with
                cold water when the juice dries completely. You can also preserve the juice in refrigerator
                and use every day for brilliantly glowing skin.
