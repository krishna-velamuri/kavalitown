                    Jeggings are a recent variant of leggings. They are leggings that take certain attributes
                    from jeans, such as color and style and particularly a colored seam down the side,
                    thus a mixture of the two and hence the adoption of the name "Jeggings". Some styles
                    have even taken the jean-like look to such lengths as adding faux pockets and faux
                    zip-flies to add to the look.

                    Compare with leggings, jeggings are more stylish and secure. Jeggings are bit costly
                    than leggings. There are different fittings in jeggings.

                    In contemporary usage, leggings refers to tight, form-fitting trousers that extend
                    from the waist to the ankles. In the United States, they are sometimes referred
                    to as tights. However, the two words are not synonymous as the word tights refers
                    to opaque pantyhose.

                    The fabric should have a bit of weight to it. Yes, it will be stretchy but there should be a zip
                    and you should not see your panty line through them.  Longer tops and tunics are our jegging friends (looks good).
                    When you balance the slim structure of the jeggings and flowy unstructured in the top, it is a winning combo.

                    Jeggings will emphasize your legs, if you're not too fond of yours. Jeggings look great worn with ballet flats or loafers for
                    casual but add a heel,
                    your legs will look like they have taken on supermodel proportions.  If the jegging is too long for your leg,
                    it is important that you get it taken up so that the effect is not the opposite of that of a supermodel.
