        <h2>Measure your Feet</h2>
        <p>
            Measuring your foot size is the first step in obtaining the most comfortable shoes. Most shoe stores will have measuring devices,
            and the sales people at those stores will be happy to help you get an accurate measurement. Many people have feet that are two different sizes.
            In this case, wear a size that suits your larger foot. Measure your feet every few years! your feet change shape the years go on.
            you want roughly a half inch between your longest toe and the end of your shoe for best comfort.

        </p>
        <h2>Identify your Arch Type</h2>
        <p>
            Most feet fall into three categories based on the shape of the arch. Choose shoes that accomodate the shape of your arch to achieve
            the most comfortable fit. If you are unsure about the shape of your feet, take a look at your foot print, you likely have low arches.
            If you can see a very little, high arches.
        </p>
        <h3>Choose firm midsole for neutral-arched or flat feet.</h3>
        <p>
            Neutral-arched feet are neither overly nor under-arched. Those with neutral arches can generally wear shoes of their choosing, as
            there is a little need to compensate for shortcomings associated with the arches. Shoes with firm midsoles and moderate rear-foot stability
            are strong all-round choices for comfort and longevity, as they help sustain the natural stride of the foot.
        </p>
        <h3>Choose a straight shoe for low-arched or flat feet.</h3>
        <p>
            Low arches cause muscle stress and joint problems for the feet and legs. As a result, find a shoe with straight(the overall shape of the shoe)
            and strong motion control to help stabilize your stride. Additionallly, look for shoe with raised insoles or supports that alleviate some of the
            excess pressure placed on the feet where the arch typically rests.
        </p>
        <h3>Find shoes with overall arch support for high-arched feet.</h3>
        <p>
            High arches can cause strain on joints and muscles and overall foort pain(especailly at the heels) as they do not absorb shock well. Look for shoes that feature cushioned arch support to alleviate some of the
            impact that your foot experiences during your stride.
        </p>
        <h3>Look at product details before you buy</h3>
        <p>
            Look at product details of any shoe you are interested in purchasing before you buy. The product details can be found on the box of the shoe or
            near where the shoe is being displayed and lists many of the details necessary for choosing the right shoe for the right foot, such as type of
            midsole, arch support and more. Ig you don't see the product information or need help choosing the right shoe, ask an employee at the store. They
            can help you choose the right shoe with the right features after you explain your needs. The shoe manufacturer's website may also list product features that can help you make the right decission.
        </p>
        <h2>Adjusting the shoe as necessary</h2>
        <h3>Add an insert</h3>
        <P>
            If your shoe lacks enough cushion, purchase an insert and place it in your shoe. They come in variety of thickness and are made of a variety of comfortable materials. Through soft gel inserts can feel good, they may not last long and can disrupt the natural waling movement of your stride.
            Find an insert that offers comfort but is hard enough to support your feet where they need it most. Some shoe stores have scanners that can identify where you need support. Try standing one one to get a better ideal of what to look for in an insert. You can always ask a salesperson to help operate the device.
        </P>
        <h3>Break in the shoe</h3>
        <p>
            Some shoes become more comfortable and broken in the more they are worn. If you have a pair of dress shoes that your intend on using for long social events, spend a few evenings wearing them in advance of such events in order to break them in and make them more comfortble for those special occasions. Shoes can also be stretched to offer more wiggle room. Take your shoes to a local cobbler to see if your shoes can be stretched without damaging the shoe. You may also purchase a self-stretching kit at many shoe stores.
        </p>
        <h3>Apply moleskin</h3>
        <p>
            Apply a molekin or other protective patch to your feet to protect them from chafing while you break in the shoe. Such patches can also be applied directly to the shoe in the areas that are giving your trouble. Moleking pads will help stretch out tight shoes, since it adds additional bulk to your foot.
