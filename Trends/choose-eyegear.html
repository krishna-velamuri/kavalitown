        <h2>Choose Right Eyegear</h2>
        <h6>There are three main parameters to choose the right eye gear. Those are Picking glasses for protection, for medical condition and for style.</h6>

        <h3>Picking Glasses for Protection</h3>
        <p>            
            <b>Aim to protect your eyes first and foremost</b>
            Excessive exposure to UV radiation can cause a varierty of problems for your eyes such as cataracts, burns and cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want your sunglasses to protect you from these risks, look for pairs that block at lease 99% of VUB rays and at least 95% of UVA rays. Also
            look for the amount of cover the sunglasses provide. Look at how much you can see around the frames like sunglasses let in sun from the top or sides?
        </p>
        <h6>Do not buy sunglasses if they are labeled as COSMETIC or don't provide any information on UV protection.</h6>
        <p>
            Look for scratch resistance, many lenses have very fragile coatings. If you are spending much money, you want them to last. Fortunately damaged lenses can be
            replaced for most models.
        </p>
        <h3>Picking Glasses for Style</h3>
        <h4>Based on Shape of your face</h4>

        <p>
            <b>Oval Face:</b> The oval type usually has the perfect face shape, and can wear any style of glasses. Avoid frames that are eigther too thick
            or too thin. Don't choose frame wider than your face width.
        </p>
        <P>
            <b>Square Face</b>
            Because this face type has very stright, pronounced jawline and edges, choose round glasses to balance out these features. Make sure the frames are not too thick.
            Try to choose wider glasses and avoid rectangular glasses with sharp corners.
        </P>
        <p>
            <b>Round Face</b>
            A round face has plumper cheeks and chin. Choose polygonal or square glasses that have an angle design to balance this out. Look for thicker frames.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Long Face</b>
            Choose larger glasses and the polygonal frame to modify a long face. Popular retro glasses and spoarts glasses can be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Flat Face</b>
            Choose darker glasses and frames to highlight the contours of the face. Bright colors can also make expressions more vivid.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Make sure the Sunglasses fit properly</b>
            Try them on and make sure they do not pich around your head. The weight should be evenly distributed between your ears and nose. Make sure that your eye lashes
            should not touch the frame or glasses. Glasses should be your stand on the bridge of the nose and ears. If they feel inclined to one side, you need to adjust them.
            In addition, use the measuring rule that an eyelash is less than the lens.
        </p>
        <h3>Choosing Glasses Color Wisely</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Note that the color of the lenses doesn't just affect your fashion statement, it affects how well you detect contrast and diffentiate colors.</b><br />
            Some colors enhace contrast, which can be useful; however, this is often at the expense of color distinction, which can cause problems (when you are driving
            and need to be able to differentiate the colors of traffic light.). Some sunglasses even come with interchaneable lenses so you can change the color easily,
            depending on what your doing.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grey glasses reduce light intencity without affecting contrast or distorting colors.</li>
            <li>Brow glasses partially enhance contrast by blocking some blue light. Good for snow sports. Also generally good for hunting or fielding in bright light, against open backgrounds.</li>
            <li>
                Amber/Yellow glasses signficantly enhance constrast because they block most or all blue light, and that makes them popular among hunters or cricketers who benefit from that
                constrast when looking targets against the sky. They are bad, however, for any activity that requires color recongnition. Good for snow sports.
            </li>
            <li>Red/Orange glasses are good for snow sports but only on overcast days. If you are a cricker, orange glasses or good for catch ball against open backgrounds.</li>
            <li>Voilet glasses are good for cricketers who needs to see ball on a green background.</li>
            <li>Copper glasses will mute the sky and grass against a golf ball.</li>
            <li>Blue and Green glasses enhance contrast with a yellow tennis ball.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            <b>Check for distortion</b><br />
            Hold the glasses up to a fluorescent lamp. As you move the sunglasses up and down, check that wave distrotion does't happen. If it doesn't happen, this is a good sign.
        </p>
        <h3>Selecting Right Lens Material</h3>
        <p>
            scratched up glasses are useless glasses. Lenses are made from NXT  polyurethane are impact-resistant, flexible, light weight, and have great optical clarity. but they are expensive.
            <br />
            - Glass is heavier, expensive, and will spider if broken.<br />
            - Polycorbonate is not as scratch-resistant and provides glass like optical clarity than NXT polyurethane or glass, but it's more affordable.<br />
            - Polymide is a less used material, which provides glass like optical clarity, without the danger of shattering.<br />
            - There are significant differences in scratch resistance of polycarbonate lenses depending on the hardcoat finish applied during construction.<br />
            - Acrylic is also affordable, but it's the least durable and optically clear. They are also weak when exposed to heat and often deform. The best choice is glass or resin material.
