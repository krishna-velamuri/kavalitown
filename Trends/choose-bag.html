        <h2>Choosing Bag</h2>
        <p>
            The right handbag can flatter your figure and complete a favorite outfit. You might end up carrying your handbag every day for months on end so
            it is essential that you choose one that is right for you.
        </p>
        <p>The tips below explain an easy to remember, 5 point process for choosing the right handbag every time.</p>
        <h3>Length</h3>
        <p>
            There is one easy rule to remember here. The part of your body where the bottom of the bag sits will be accentuated.
            So, if you have small, boy hips, having a bag which sits on your hips will make your shape look more feminine.
            If you have large hips, try a bag which sits at your waist line, accentuating the tapering of your waist and making you look slimmer.
            Handbags that sit at waist level will flatter most shapes in fact, so it is always good to have a bag of this type in your collection.
        </p>
        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>
            Do not be tempted just to follow the fashion here, very small bags on very tall girls will get lost,
            and alternatively if you are on the short side, you will be swamped with a large or oversized bag!
        </p>
        <h3>Shape</h3>
        <p>
            Try to choose a handbag which compliments your own shape. To do this, think about your overall shape, and then buy handbags with opposite features.
            For example, if you are tall and slim, choose a handbag which is rounded and slouchy. If you are short and curvy,
            handbags with strong angles will look great on you.
        </p>
        The size of handbag should be proportionate to the person's body type
        <ul>
            <li>	Short and petite women appear taller with small handbags and shorter with large handbags.</li>
            <li>	Tall and slim women appear larger with small handbags and look best with midsize, large and oversized styles.</li>
            The shape of a handbag should be opposite of the person's body type
            <li>	Short women look taller carrying a long rectangular handbag.</li>
            <li>	Slim and tall women benefit from a round handbag.</li>
            The length of a handbag – where the bottom hits the body – emphasizes that area
            <li>	Short handbags make busts appear larger, so choose styles with longer straps to avert attention.</li>
            <li>	Most women look good wearing handbags that hang to the mid-torso.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            They also suggest using handbags to balance out your figure. For example if you have a pear-shaped or triangle body type
            (waist and hips wider than your shoulders), a satchel handbag that falls between your waist and your hips could make your
            top area seem larger and balance out your figure. If you have a rectangle body type (shoulders, waist, and hips about the same width),
            a hobo or shoulder bag that falls at your waist could add slight curves.
        </p>
        <h3>Style</h3>
        <P>
            Think about your general style. If you usually wear casual clothes, going for a very formal handbag is not a good idea! This can be tricky,
            so make sure you do a bit of research. Look in fashion magazines for models wearing similar style clothes to you, then make a note of the
            types of handbags that they have been dressed with. You may not like that particular handbag, but note the style, and think about whether
            you would like it in a different colour, a different material, or if it were slightly bigger or smaller. The main thing is to note the style,
            i.e. if it is a tote, a clutch, or a slouch shoulder bag. Having said all of that, if you are buying a handbag for a particular occasion,
            where you will be wearing something outside of your usual style, be sure to complete the above magazine steps for the style of outfit you
            will be wearing! You are not going to buy something you don’t like, so there will always be a bit of ‘you’ in the handbag, no matter what
            style you choose.
        </P>
        <h4>Examine your handbag for:</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Stitching. The stitching and seaming should be consistent throughout, without any loose or stray threads. If the bag has a pattern,
                    the print should also match at the seams. Also tug on any embellishments like hanging pulls or chains to make sure
                    they aren't loose and won't fall off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quality zippers and other hardware. One of the best signs of quality is how the zipper opens and closes, it should glide smoothly. Similarly,
                    other closures like buttons or clasps should close neatly and easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Connections for the straps. The seams where the straps meet the bag body are very important, since those are high pressure areas.
                    Also, Real Simple advises us to stay away from bags with handles that aren't stitched along the edges of the straps and that
                    are only glued, because those handles will eventually separate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fewer seams and parts. The more parts (snaps, latches, buttons, etc.) there are to a handbag, the more ways your bag can break.
                    Similarly, as Saddleback Leather explains, many pieces of leather stitched together into a sort of quilt means lots of seams—and a weaker bag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other fine details. Sometimes it's the little touches that show off a quality handbag. Things like feet on the bottom of the bag so
                    it doesn't get dirty when you put it down, a key fob on the inside of the bag, a comfortable zipper pull, and exterior
                    pockets with magnetic closures.
                </li>
            </ul>
